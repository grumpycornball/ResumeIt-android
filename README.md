# ResumeIt-android

This is small project I created few months back this repository is part of the project which contains the android extention needed. Idea is to let user carry on their task(browsing the web or playing video) they are doing in their chrome browser and resume it on their android devices in just a click.

You can either build the project from scratch or simply download and run apk.

How to build:

1. Setup firebase for the project i.e add the app in your firebase project (Can be empty)

3. And take a build.
